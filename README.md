Scripts Python for ML project

# in notebooks folder
We store the notebooks to be executed sequentially
>step1_ML_Dataset : to generate the required datasets 
>Step2_ML_EDA_Dataset : to perform the Exploratory Dataset Analysis, then create the cleaned dataset
>Step2_ML_EDA_DatasetClean : to perform the Exploratory Dataset Analysis on the cleaned dataset
>Step4_ML_ModelClassification : to experiment classification models on dataset
>Step4_ML_ModelRegression : to experiment and combine previous classification models with regression models to improve predictions

# in data folder
We store every individual datasets retrieved from step1_ML_Dataset
>a complete dataset Full_dataset_reference.csv was built then the cleaned one in Cleaned_Features_for_ML.csv
